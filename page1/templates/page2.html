But I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he’s a great man and I will never forget him.</p>

                <p class="text">What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I’ve written as an adult (and certainlyevery one that has been published), almost every email I’ve ever written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And though his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You’ll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.</p>

                    means a lot – I got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple.
                    And, of I’ve been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with
                    Steve. I do hope he’ll be remembered around the world as a genius.</p>
